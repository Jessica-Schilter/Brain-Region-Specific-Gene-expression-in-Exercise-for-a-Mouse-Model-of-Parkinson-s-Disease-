a separate analysis was done for the two types of controls in regards to percentage of expression. 

"RNA-sequencing on 4 brain regions from control animals, MPTP-induced PD mice and MPTP-induced PD mice treated with exercise for 12 weeks were performed" in the original study.

I will be analyzing the above-mentioned experiment and focus on two types of samples. (Cortex and cerebellum). This is the center for memory and balance/ posture respectively. This study tested effects of 12-week treadmill exercise on Parkinsonâ€™s symptomatic mice.

Control: saline, non-MPTP mice
Control: MPTP-induced PD mice 
Treatment: MPTP-induced PD mice treated with exercise for 12 weeks.

This study has RNA-sequencing data on 4 brain regions: Cerebellum, Cortex, nigra and striatum.
Study used the pvalue, not the adjusted pvalue.
